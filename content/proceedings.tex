\section{Test}
This is just a first test of the PRL template. 
For some reason I get right-bounded text. To investigate this, I am writing nonsense. 
One could ask: Why is he not using a lorem text? Well, in LaTeX I could even use a small command for that. 
But sometimes its just easier doing some ugly shit, than thinking too much about how to do it right!
