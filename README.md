Proceedings for the lecture 'Flavour Physics in Theory and Experiment'

[Latest PDF Version](https://github.com/The-Ludwig/Flavour-Physics-Proceedings/releases/latest/download/Flavour-Physics-Proceedings.pdf)
[![Build LaTeX](https://github.com/The-Ludwig/Flavour-Physics-Proceedings/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/The-Ludwig/Flavour-Physics-Proceedings/actions/workflows/build.yml)

For this lecture we need to write proceedings to be able to write the examn. I chose to write proceedings for [this talk about lepton flavour universality](https://indico.cern.ch/event/976688/).

# Building
To produce the output to `build/main.pdf` simply run
```sh
make
```

To use continuous building (i.e. while working on the document) use 
```sh
make work
```

# Dependencies 
You need 
- texlive 
- make

# Credits
As with all of my LaTeX stuff: Since I learned it thanks to the [PeP Toolbox Workshop](https://toolbox.pep-dortmund.org/)
you will proably find a lot of copied code from their workshop. If you want to learn LaTeX and speak German, have a look at their awesome resources! :)
